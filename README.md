Salvaviajes
===========

Summary  
We are working to build an SMS / web reporting system for migrants traveling through Central America and into the United States. Through our platform, they can report humanitarian issues, emergencies, and the like.
The phone number to report an issue is (732) 820-0064. It is a Google Voice number. When a user contacts our system, this java program will hold a conversation with them to gather the necessary information regarding their case.
This java program loops every few seconds to check for unread messages from Google Voice.  When unread messages are received, it processes them and prompts the user for more information.
Once the user profile (of the issue) is complete, the user data is saved to our database, the message feed is clear, and the process continues.

In order to test the system, this java application must be running!

As part of this project, we designed a website (www.salvaviajes.com) to present the data and allow for users to communicate with us online.
