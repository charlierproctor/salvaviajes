Summary  
We are working to build an SMS/web communication platform for migrant alerts within Central America and Southern North America. The base product will allow users to report and search for nearby issues.  Emergency SOS messages are automatically routed to local organizations in the area.We strive to provide a safe, anonymous place for individuals to report issues ranging from alerting nearby support organizations of large, inbound migrant-groups to reporting threats of violence from civilian, cartel, or state officials.  In addition to the SMS system, our web platform will allow migrants with internet access to appropriately plan for obstacles along their path of travel.
